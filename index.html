        <p>Dharamshala or Dharamshala (Hindi: धर्मशाला, pronounced [d̪ʱərəmˈɕaːlaː] or [d̪ʱərmˈɕaːlaː]; Tibetan: དྷ་རམ་ས་ལ་), is a hill station in Himachal Pradesh, famed for its large Tibetan community centred around the activities of the Dalai Lama.</p>

            <h2>Understand</h2>

            <p>"Dharamshala" literally means "a spiritual dwelling" and in loose translation as a shelter or rest house for pilgrims and travellers. Traditionally, such dharamshalas (pilgrims' rest houses) were commonly constructed near pilgrimage destinations (often in remote areas) to give visitors a place to sleep for the night. When the first permanent settlement was created in the place now called Dharamshala, there was one such pilgrims' rest house on the site, and the settlement took its name from that dharamshala.
            After the arrival of the British, the area was developed into a cantonment. At one point, it was mooted to be the summer capital of India. But this was not to be, as much of the town was destroyed in the 7.8 magnitude earthquake of 4th April 1905. The disaster killed over 10,000 people in this sparsely populated area.
            Dharamshala came on the world map in 1959 with the arrival of the Dalai Lama and the Tibetan Government in Exile [40]. Currently, it is a very popular hang-out for foreigners, backpackers and students of Buddhism. Indeed, it is now perhaps a little too popular and many would say the town, and especially McLeod Ganj, is little more than a backpacker ghetto. Don't come here on a long weekend expecting peace and tranquility.</p>

            <h2>Orientation</h2>
            <p>Dharamshala is divided into two distinct areas that are separated by a 10 min, 9 km bus or jeep ride.</p>

            <p>Dharamshala, consists of most of the government offices, Schools, the local Hospital, and commercial areas. It also has a few tea gardens. One in the area of Chilgari and another just beyond Dari. It is a typical small Indian town that, other than for the bus station, is of little interest to tourists. One can enjoy the view while driving through.
            Upper Dharamshala, known more commonly as McLeod Ganj is named after Sir Donald Friell McLeod the once the British Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab. It is home to the Tibetan community and the centre of tourist activity. Unless specifically stated, all listings in this article refer to McLeod Ganj. To know more about mcleodganj history and have some up-to-date information, MclloPedia is a page dedicated to mcleodganj and beyond.
            Bhagsu, is 2 km north-east and is a small quiet urban area. Bhagsu is full of shops and restaurants and has a public pool popular with locals.
            Dharamkot, is 3.5 km north and is up the hill from McLeod Ganj. Divided into lower and upper Dharamkot, lower Dharamkot is similar to a smaller Bhagsu, with a number of restaurants and hostels all in close proximity. Upper Dharamkot is nestled in the woods and is ideal for those looking for a quiet escape from urban life or those wanting quicker access to the trails that start just at the edges of Dharamkot.
            Villages near McLeod Ganj include Forsyth Ganj, a short hike away on the way up from Lower Dharamshala.</p>

            <p>For a quiet and basic experience, try Naddi (3 km) or Talnu (11 km).</p>

            <h2>Climate</h2> 
            <div class="col-sm-4">
            <img src="C:\Users\acer\Desktop\ChooseToCode\images\350px-Dharamsala_View.JPG"/>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-8">
            <p>Lower Dharamshala is at an altitude of 1,400 m, while McLeod Ganj is at around 1,750 m, making them considerably cooler than the plains below. Temperatures in January can dip below freezing, while June can go up to 38°C. The monsoon season from July to September is very wet. Even in March, when the Dalai Lama holds his teachings and the weather down in Delhi is downright balmy, you will still need a heavy winter coat. These can be purchased at reasonable prices in the town.</p>

            <h2>Get in</h2>

            <h3>Plane</h3>
            <p>Gaggal Airport (IATA: DHM) is at Gaggal near Kangra, a distance of 15 km from McLeodganj by road on MDR44 and NH20. Daily flights are available from New Delhi by air liners Spice Jet & Air India. One way ticket can be booked for around Rs. 4500 if booked few months in advance, tickets gets really expensive if you book nearer to the travel date. A taxi from the airport to McLeodganj should be Rs. 800-900. The trip will usually take 30-45 minutes.</p>

            <h3>By bus</h3>
            <p>Most people come to Dharamshala by bus as the nearest railhead is at Pathankot (Punjab) around 90 Kms away. It has good connections with other parts of Northern India, although the journeys are often slow due to the narrow, winding roads in the hills.

            <p>The main bus terminal is in Lower Dharamshala, but some public HRTC buses to Delhi and Pathankot go all the way to the main square of McLeod Ganj, where you can also book advance tickets for the return trip.</p>

            <p>Buses from Pathankot cost around Rs 120 and take 4 hours to reach Dharamshala/McLeod Ganj. Once in Dharamshala, if your bus does not go all the way to McLeod Ganj, another bus can take you the rest of the way for 14 rs. 15-20 minutes.</p>

            <p>Private bus companies are available for travel from Manali, Dehradun and Delhi. Overnight buses operate from New Delhi with many leaving from the Tibetan colony of Majnu ka Tilla. These services take upwards of 13 hr and cost from Rs 600 for a basic bus to Rs 1100 for a plusher Volvo. Tickets for Himachal Road Transport Corporation (HRTC- A State Government body) can be booked online at http://hrtc.gov.in/HRTCTickets/ Chandigarh, 236 km distant from McLeodganj, is a gruelling 8-9 hr trip in an ordinary bus.</p>

            <h3>By train</h3>
            <p>The nearest broad gauge railhead is at Pathankot and the neighboring small station of Pathankot Cantt, a comfortable overnight journey from Delhi. Train buffs can continue on the very slow and rickety but pretty Kangra Valley Railway to Kangra, a journey that easily takes up to 6 hours and still leaves you around 25 km from McLeod Ganj. Many travellers choose to continue from Pathankot towards Dharamshala by bus or taxi. If you do choose to travel to Kangra by train, then from the train station you will need to hire an autorickshaw to reach the bus stand where buses are available to take you to Dharamshala.


            <p>If coming by Pathankot station (PTK), the Pathankot bus station is just across from the railway with buses plying for Dharamshala. Pathankot Cantt (PTKC) is 3-4 kms from the bus stand / PTK station - rickshaws are aplenty. The 4 hour bus ride to Dharamshala costs 120 rs. per person. Once in Dharamshala, another bus can take you to McLeod Ganj for 14 rs. 15-20 minutes.</p>  


            <h3>Taxi</h3>
            <p>A taxi from Pathankot to McLeod Ganj, a distance of 88 km, takes about 3 hours, and the official fare from Pathankot is Rs 2,500 (return). However the asking rate is always Rs 2,200 and you can negotiate to around Rs 2,000 ( 250 rs is probably charged as a toll ). This is October 2014 rate for a sedan (Dzire ).

            <p>Ola taxis can be hired from Amritsar(about INR 3,500) or Jalandhar (about INR 2,500)</p>


            <p>Taxis from Delhi are often available leaving from Majnu Ki Tila Tibetan settlement in North Delhi on the ring road. Many people take a taxi to Delhi which takes about 10 hours and pay the return fare simply because they don't want to deal with the hassle and pain of taking a bus. These taxis need to return to Dharamshala, and many times will sell seats in their car for the same price as a bus ticket. To find these taxis, go to the Majnu Ki Tila Tibetan Settlement Bus Stand and look for taxis which have Himachal Pradesh License plates. You can negotiate with a driver. Often the taxis will leave in the evening and you will arrive in Dharamshala early the next morning.</p>
